Hi, my name is Carrie Snyder and I am an Advanced Practice Nursing working in Cancer Genetics. I provide genetic counseling and testing to individuals who are at an increased risk for cancer.
I am interested in learning how to pull, manage and analyze large data sets related to hereditary cancer risk.
I am new to computer science and look forward to learning all I can!
